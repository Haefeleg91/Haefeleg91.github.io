                <p>Next semester I will be taking a 3D printing course and I plan on taking this LFO and actually printing it. Most of the final touches that will be needed to get it ready would be pieces that actually fit together. I feel like the biggest hurdle would be making the hip and shoulder joints physically possible. Regardless what happens, I plan on printing a statue of the robot near the beginning of the semester just as a keepsake.</p>

                <p>3D printing is a fascinating technology. Before it became an industry standard most engineering problems were costly to fix because of prototypes that either took a long time to make or needed to use industrial grade materials that were costly. Now, these parts are able to be made in a few days instead of weeks and it works wonderfully for projects outside the professional sense.</p>

                <p>One of the best uses of 3D printing now is to test the size of a part to see if it'll fit together in a preexisting assembly, of course another is just for making fun desk toppers. The ability to 3D print is getting much more affordable too, when they first became available to the public, they were small machines that cost anywhere from $2,500 to $5,000 dollars, now they range from $4-$600 for basic ones with the higher end ones at around $2,000 or so. The time to print has shrunk considerably too, the earlier machines took upwards to a few minutes per layer, and had to clear the nozzle after each layer, now they don't need to clean the nozzle every time and it generally takes a few seconds per layer.</p>

                <p>My final goal for this 3D printing endeavor is to have each part printed with the ability to snap together, so that I can have a fully articulated model of this robot. To start it off though I think I'm going to get a basic solid piece until I get more adept with CADD and 3D printing software. I feel like adding an internal skeleton would help out a lot in this regard. I still have some of these skeletons so I feel like if I'm able to get the dimensions right I could essentially print my own armor for it and snap it to the skeleton, this unfortunately won't happen for a long time.</p>
