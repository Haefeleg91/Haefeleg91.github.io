This name was also a reference to the fact that the robots used waves of transparent light particles as both a fuel source and a way to "surf" in the air with their boards.</p>

There are a vast amount of softwares that range from educational to professional. This project, and my first CADD software, was done in Autodesk Inventor but there are many more types out there. The biggest breakthrough in the past few years has been 3D printing where a model is printed with heated plastic for a scale model of the model, these models can be used as prototypes or just as cool knick knacks to have around.</p>

You can then put all the parts together to make an assembly and can even add movement to the assemblies. The uses for CADD are vast and some may even be a bit surprising.
