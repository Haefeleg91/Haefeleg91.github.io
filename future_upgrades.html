                <p>I also plan on giving the LFO the ability to transform slightly. In the show, the LFOs were able to lay down into a vehicle mode to allow for long range travel with low fuel cost. This is a picture of what the vehicle mode looked like in the show.</p>

            <p>I plan on redesigning the head and body a second time to make room for the folding waist design and then remake the backpack and actually add the wheels to the back, which double as thrusters as well, the biggest thing though is the head. I really want to redesign the head to make it fit more with the theme and make it more head like then it currently is. The original inspiration I used for the head was from a completely different medium so it never really fit to begin with</p>

            <p>I like how most of the parts came out and only need minor tweaks to allow clearance between the connecting pieces because as it stands at the moment none of the parts can actually connect together and move if it was actually made through 3D printing. Most of the parts are either solid tubes and rods with no way of clipping together and are the same exact size. For these to work they need to have notches cut into them so they can clip together and they need some clearance so after they are clipped together they can actually move.</p>

            <h1>Internal Skeleton</h1>
            <!-- <img src="imgs/explosion1.jpg" alt="LFO explosion" style="width: 70%;"> -->
            <p>I would really like to redesign the robot from the ground up and make an internal skeleton with the armor snapping around or pressing into the skeleton. I got this idea from a model kit that I had when I was younger and it seems doable. I can use the current parts and cut them into pieces and use a tool in my CADD software to shell them out. I don't feel like it would take long to do this. The longest part would be making the skeleton and adjusting it to the proper size. If I am able to do this though, making upgrades would be as simple as making new shells.</p>
